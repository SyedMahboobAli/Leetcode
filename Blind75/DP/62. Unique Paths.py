        '''
        At any cell (i, j):

dp[j] holds paths from above (old value before update)

dp[j-1] holds paths from left (just updated)
So we correctly combine both directions, overwriting as we go leftâ†’right.
and first is set to 1 anyway, but the first column is always 1 as we second loop we are always starting from index 1
